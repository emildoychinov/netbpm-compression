# NETBPM compression
  A project for the Algorithms and data structures class @ELSYS

# USE
  ```gcc netbpm_compression.c
     ./a [command] [filename]
  ```
  A file is made with an extension such as
  ```
    .cpbm
    .cpgm
  ```
 # COMMON PROBLEMS
  If the provided file has comments in it such as
   ```
      #hey! this is a comment
   ```
   Or it is in a binary format like
   ```
        P4, P5, P6
   ```
   The compression may not work correctly
   
   # TODO
   Compression and decompression of .ppm images
